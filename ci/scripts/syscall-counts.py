"""Count read- and stat-family system calls in an `strace -f` log.

Only the traced process and its threads count. A pid that calls `execve` after
the first one is a spawned child (`git`, `true`), whose calls vary by host, so
its lines are skipped. The resumed half of an interrupted call (`<... read
resumed>`) was already counted where it started.

A log that cannot be a measurement fails (exit 1) rather than counting zero:
no syscall lines, no initial `execve` of the traced program, or a family with
no calls at all (every alint run reads, stats, opens, and lists directories).

    syscall-counts.py --syscalls   print the strace `-e trace=` list
    syscall-counts.py LOG          print `family count` lines for LOG

Used by reference-perf-gate.sh (ADR-0023, V21-6).
