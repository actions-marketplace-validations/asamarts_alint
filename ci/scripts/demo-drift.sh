# demo-drift.sh — keep README's demo GIF honest.
#
# The GIF (demo/alint.gif) is generated from demo/alint.tape, which runs a fixed
# command sequence against demo/fixture. If a bundled rule changes, a fixer is
# added, or output shape shifts, the GIF silently becomes a LIE on our primary
# discovery surface, and nothing else in CI would notice.
#
# This gate replays the tape's exact sequence and pins alint's real behaviour.
# When it fails, the fix is usually: re-record the GIF (`vhs demo/alint.tape`)
# and update the expectations below in the same commit.
#
# Deliberately a TEXT-level gate, not a byte-diff of the GIF: GIF encoding is not
# reproducible across vhs/ttyd/ffmpeg versions, so a byte-diff would flake
# constantly and teach everyone to ignore it. What actually matters is that the
# demo still tells the truth about what alint does.
