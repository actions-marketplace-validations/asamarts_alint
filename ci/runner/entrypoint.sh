# Stop the agent on a signal. Deliberately NOT deregistering here.

# SIGTERM arrives on an ordinary `podman restart`, on `podman stop`, and on host
# shutdown. Removing the registration there invalidates the very identity the
# config volume exists to preserve: the next start restores credentials the
# server has already deleted, and `--restart unless-stopped` turns that into a
# loop. The failure is delayed and confusing, because `config.sh remove` needs a
# still-valid registration token, so a restart in the first hour after setup
# destroys the runner while a restart the next day appears to work.
#
# Found in the wubhub pilot of `aplan`, which copied this runner pattern: one
# restart minutes after provisioning produced fifteen container restarts and
# zero registered runners. Deregistration is an explicit teardown action
# (`teardown.sh --purge`), never something a routine restart does by accident.
