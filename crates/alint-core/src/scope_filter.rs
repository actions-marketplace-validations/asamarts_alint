//! `ScopeFilter` — per-file rule gate that scopes rule
//! application to files whose ancestor directories contain a
//! named manifest. The "closest-ancestor manifest" pattern, in
//! practical terms.
//!
//! Composes with the existing per-file `paths:` glob and the
//! tree-level `when:` gate as an AND. A file matches a rule
//! iff every gate it has accepts the file.
//!
//! ## Why
//!
//! Bundled ecosystem rulesets (`rust@v1`, `node@v1`, …) need
//! to scope per-file rules to only files inside a package of
//! the matching ecosystem. A `**/*.rs` glob alone is too
//! broad: in a polyglot monorepo, `services/web/scripts/
//! migrate.rs` shouldn't be governed by Rust hygiene rules
//! just because it has the `.rs` extension. With
//! `scope_filter: { has_ancestor: Cargo.toml }`, the rule
//! only fires on files that have a `Cargo.toml` somewhere in
//! their ancestor chain — i.e., files inside an actual Rust
//! package.
//!
//! ## Semantics
//!
//! For a file at `crates/api/src/main.rs`, `has_ancestor:
//! Cargo.toml` walks the ancestor chain `crates/api/src/`,
//! `crates/api/`, `crates/`, root, and returns true on the
//! first match. The walk includes the file's own directory:
//! `crates/api/Cargo.toml` itself matches because
//! `crates/api/` (the file's parent) contains a `Cargo.toml`.
//!
//! See `docs/design/v0.9/scope-filter.md` for full design,
//! pinned decisions, and the bundled-ruleset migration plan.
//!
//! ## Performance
//!
//! Each `has_ancestor` check walks `Path::parent()` upward
//! and consults [`FileIndex::contains_file`] (the v0.9.5
//! path-index) at each step. Both operations are O(1)
//! hashlookups; per-file overhead is `O(depth × M)` where
//! `M` is the number of names in the `has_ancestor` list.
//! Typical: 5 levels × 1 manifest = 150 ns / file. At 1M
//! files × 5 rules with `scope_filter`, total overhead is
//! ~750 ms — and that's before the file-read savings the
//! filter unlocks.
